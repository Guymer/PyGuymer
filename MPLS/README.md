# PyGuymer.MPLS

This sub-module is a native Python implementation of a parser for Blu-ray MPLS files. It has used [the excellent MPLS Wiki](https://github.com/lerks/BluRay/wiki/MPLS) by @lerks with a little help from [a WikiBook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User:Bdinfo/mpls) too. This project started because, as of February 2018, [ffprobe](https://www.ffmpeg.org/ffprobe.html) doesn't return the language information for the audio streams in a Blu-ray playlist.
